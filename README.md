One-Time Passwords (OTPs) are commonly used for secure authentication in cardless transactions. Here’s a basic overview of how OTP generation typically works for such transactions:

1. User Initiates Transaction
The user initiates a cardless transaction, usually through a mobile app or an online platform.

2. System Request
The system or application requests an OTP to verify the user’s identity.

3. OTP Generation
An OTP is generated by the server. This OTP is a unique, time-sensitive code that can be used only once.

Common Methods for OTP Generation:
Time-Based One-Time Password (TOTP):

Algorithm: TOTP is based on a shared secret key and the current time. It uses the HMAC-SHA-1 algorithm and is often used in conjunction with a time-based factor.
How It Works: The server and the client (usually an app) share a secret key. The OTP is generated by combining this secret key with the current time. The OTP changes at regular intervals (e.g., every 30 seconds).
HMAC-Based One-Time Password (HOTP):

Algorithm: HOTP is based on a shared secret key and a counter. It uses the HMAC-SHA-1 algorithm as well.
How It Works: The server and client share a secret key and a counter value. The OTP is generated based on this counter. Each time an OTP is requested, the counter is incremented, ensuring that each OTP is unique.
4. OTP Transmission
The OTP is transmitted to the user through a secure channel, such as:

SMS: The OTP is sent as a text message to the user’s registered mobile number.
Email: The OTP is sent to the user’s registered email address.
Mobile App: The OTP is displayed in a secure authentication app (e.g., Google Authenticator, Authy).
5. User Inputs OTP
The user receives the OTP and inputs it into the transaction interface.

6. Verification
The system verifies the OTP:

Match Check: It compares the OTP entered by the user with the OTP generated and sent.
Expiration Check: It checks whether the OTP is still within its valid time window or has expired.
7. Transaction Completion
If the OTP is valid and matches, the transaction is processed. Otherwise, the user may be prompted to request a new OTP.

Security Considerations:
Time Sensitivity: Ensure OTPs have a short lifespan to reduce the risk of misuse.
Single Use: OTPs should be used only once to prevent replay attacks.
Secure Transmission: Always use secure channels for transmitting OTPs (e.g., HTTPS, encryption).
User Verification: Consider additional layers of security, such as biometric verification, especially for high-value transactions.
Implementing OTP correctly helps safeguard cardless transactions by adding a layer of security beyond just usernames and passwords.
