# PYTHON-PROJECT
Banks give ATM cards to clients for mileage services like cash pull-out, Leg change, balance inquiry, etc. But physical cards have some problems.
It can be stolen, skimmed, reproduced, confiscated, damaged, or expired. Due to this problem, we must find an alternate way to give better security. Numerous experimenters are allowing cardless sales through ATMs.
They proposed an abstract model for cardless Electronic ATM through which clients can do cash pull-out, balance inquiries, fund transfers, etc.
We've anatomized their protocol and planted some excrescencies on this. This protocol doesnâ€™t specify what if it's of us sale.
Either, guests get different orders of services but this protocol cannot determine which client will get which order of services.
For this application, we are using face detection with the account number, Aadhar number, PIN, mobile number, and name.
When we recognize the face then it will give us access to enter the ATM details. After that, it will send a message to the phone number.
If we enter the password it will give transaction access. for this purpose, we are using deep learning.
